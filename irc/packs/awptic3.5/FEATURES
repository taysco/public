EGGDROP -- AN IRC BOT

Eggdrop is, as far as I know, the most advanced IRC robot available.  It
has been under development since December 1993, and, unlike most other bots,
it is still regularly updated.  Its features include:

  * completely different channel user lists like having a seperate bot for 
    each channel.

  * complete channel protection, customizable via config file: permanently
    store a ban list with comments, etc

  * user records saved on disk and alterable via dcc chat: each user can
    have a password (encrypted), a list of valid hostmasks, a set of access
    flags, etc
  
  * the ability to "learn" new users (if you choose to have the bot do so)
    by letting users /MSG the bot "hello" and granting them automatic access
    of whatever type you specify (or even no access at all)

  * a "party line" available through dcc chat or telnet, with multiple 
    channels, giving you the ability to talk to people without being affected
    by netsplits

  * console mode: you can view each channel through dcc chat or telnet,
    selectively looking at mode changes, joins and parts, channel talk, or
    any combination of the above

  * a file system where people can upload and download files, in an
    environment that looks and acts (for the most part) like a typical
    unix system -- plus the ability to mark directories as hidden/
    unaccessable to people without certain user flags

  * bot network: link two or more bots together for a party line that can
    stretch not only across channels, but across irc networks (one bot on
    EFnet, one bot on Undernet, etc)

  * script language: commands and features can be added to the bot on the
    fly, by means of the TCL script language, giving you the power of TOTAL
    customization of your bot -- similar to ircII script

  * slices, dices, and juliennes fries


!!!  WARNING  !!!

Eggdrop is NOT a simple bot to use.  It is an advanced bot for people who
know IRC and know what they're doing.  If you don't know what DCC CHAT is
or how to use it -- if you don't know the difference between #channels and
&channels -- if you don't know what a clonebot or CTCP avalanche is -- then
this bot is not for you.  Choose a simpler bot like Vladbot or Baloobot or
ComBot, or find one of the many scriptbots to use.
