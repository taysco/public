Some little tricks that you may or may not know about...

*  You can "lock" a user's info line by putting a '@' as the first letter.
   They won't be able to change it any more.

*  '.status all' will dump out virtually everything you have configured on
   your bot

*  TCL has a command 'info body <proc>' that will list the contents of a
   proc.  'info args <proc>' shows what you have defined as the parameters
   for the proc.

*  You can rename a builtin command by binding over it.  To rename '.status'
   to '.report', you'd do:
     unbind dcc - status *dcc:status
     bind dcc m report *dcc:status
   The first line removes the builtin binding on '.status', and the second
   line binds '.report' to the builtin status function.  Other built-in command
   examples include:
     unbind msg - status *msg:status
     bind msg m report *msg:status
   and:
     unbind fil - share *fil:share
     bind fil m link *fil:share

*  You can unlink all bots and clear out the botnet info from memory by
   using '.unlink *'.  It erases all channel assoc's and everything.

*  You can make a selective auto-op flag (called +i) with the script:
   set flag1 i
   bind join i * join_auto_op
   proc join_auto_op {n uh h c} { putserv "MODE $c +o $n" }
