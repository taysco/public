###  set incoming-path <path>
   specifies the directory where files dcc'd to the bot will go.
   if you have turned off the file section by setting 'files-path'
   to "", then this has no effect since all files offered by dcc
   to the bot will be rejected anyway.  if you have set the
   'upload-to-pwd' to 1, then this will be ignored, and all files
   uploaded (sent) to the bot will go into whichever directory
   the user is in currently, or was in last.
