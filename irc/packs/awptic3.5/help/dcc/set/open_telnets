###  set open-telnets <0/1>
   specifies whether to accept new users via a telnet connection.
   if set to 0, the bot will only accept telnet connections from
   people who already have user records.  if set to 1, someone can
   enter "NEW" after telnetting to the bot, and create a new user
   record.
