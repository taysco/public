###  set passive <0/1>
   specifies whether the user data sharing of this bot (set share-
   users must be on) will be "passive" or "aggressive".  a passive
   bot will always download the user file from another bot.  an
   aggressive bot will always upload its user file to other bots.
   therefore, two aggressive bots will be unable to share user data.
   two passive bots will be able to share, however -- the bot that
   did the actual link will be the one to download.  (setting both
   bots passive allows the user file of the bot which has been
   online longest to take precendence, usually.)
