###  set servers <server-list>
   gives the bot a list of servers to use for IRC.  you can change
   this at any time on the fly, but if the bot's current IRC server
   (the one it's on right now) isn't in your new list, it will be
   added, to maintain coherency.  here's an example:
      set servers {
        goblin.irc.com:6667
        dragon.irc.org
      }
   note that if you omit the port, it will assume the value of the
   default-port setting.
