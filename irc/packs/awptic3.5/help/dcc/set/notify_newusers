###  set notify-newusers <nickname-list>
   specifies who to inform when the bot gets introduced to
   new users via the /MSG HELLO command.  obviously this has
   no effect unless the /MSG HELLO command is activated.
   the bot will send a note (see 'note') to each user listed
   in notify-newusers.  this can be just one nick:
      set notify-newusers "Robey"
   or several, separated by commas:
      set notify-newusers "Guy, Eden@Priscilla"
   the default is "HQ" which stands for head quarters.
   if you don't want anyone to be informed, just leave it blank.
