###  set keep-nick <0/1>
   specifies whether the bot will keep trying to regain its nickname if
   it is forced to change nicks.  if this is on, and you change the bot's
   nick on irc through a TCL script or the '.dump' command, then the bot
   will change back to its intended nick within 60 seconds.
