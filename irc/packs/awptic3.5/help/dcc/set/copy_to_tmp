###  set copy-to-tmp <0/1>
   sets whether files will be copied into your /tmp directory
   before they are sent to users who download them from the file
   system.  turning this on protects ongoing transfers from being
   affected by people moving files around in the file system, but
   if you're short of disk space or using a slow disk (** NFS **),
   you should probably turn this off.
