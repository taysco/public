###  match <attr> [channel] [[start] limit]
   shows you user records with the attributes requested: <attr> must
   start with a '+' or '-'.  records will be shown which have ALL of
   the requested '+' attributes and NONE of the requested '-' ones.
   if you specify a channel, the flags are assumed to be channel-
   specific flags.  examples:
      .match +b-h        (show all bots which aren't hubs)
      .match -o #cat     (show everyone who's not an op on #cat)
###  match <wildcard-string> [[start] limit]
   shows you user records where the nickname or any of the hostmasks
   match the wildcard string shown.

   the default limit is 20, meaning that if more than 20 user records
   match your requirements, only the first 20 will be shown.  you can
   change this limit by specifying one on the command line, though.
   if you include a limit, you may also include a starting place (the
   default is 1).  for example, to list the first 15 users who have
   hostmasks from clemson.edu:
      .match *clemson.edu 15
   to get the next 10 (if there are more than 15), you ask to list
   numbers 16 thru 25:
      .match *clemson.edu 16 25
