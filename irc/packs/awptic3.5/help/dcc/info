###  info [channel] [info-line]
   sets your info line.  this is shown via /msg commands 'who' and
   'whois', and possibly when you join the channel.  if you omit the
   info line, it will just show you what your current info line is.
   if you omit the channel name, your default info line will be
   displayed/changed.  (this is the info line shown for channels
   where you have no specific info line set.)
###  info [channel] none
   removes your info line.
