###  note <nickname[@bot]> <message>
   sends a private note to a user on the party line.  if that user
   is currently on the party line, and not marked as away, she will
   receive the message immediately.  otherwise it will be stored
   and displayed the next time that user joins the party line.  if
   you join the channel, and have notes stored for you on the bot,
   it will tell you.  to send a note to someone on a different bot,
   use "nick@bot" for the nickname.
