###  +host <nickname> <hostmask>
   Adds a hostmask to a user's record on the bot.  The hostmasks
   are where the bot will identify that user from.  Usually you
   will not need to use this command since a user can add hostmasks
   to her own record via the /MSG IDENT command, but it's here if
   you need it.
