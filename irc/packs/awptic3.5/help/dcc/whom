###  whom [channel]
   will display a table of the users currently on the joint party
   line (formed when you have two or more bots linked together).
   it will show each user's nickname, preceded by a "*" if they
   are the owner of their bot, "+" if they are a master, or "@"
   if they are an op.  in other columns it will show which bot the
   user is on, and his or her host.

   if the user is away, the away message will be shown.  likewise,
   if they are idle, the idle time will be displayed.

   if you are on a different channel than the party line (channel
   0), then this will show the people on every bot who are on
   your current channel.  you can also optionally give the "channel"
   option to list who is on a particular channel.
