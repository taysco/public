###  chattr <nickname> [attributes] [channel]
   lets you view and change the attributes (flags) field for a user.
   for example, to give Lamer the p and f flags:
      .chattr Lamer +pf
   or to remove Denali from the global op list:
      .chattr Denali -o
   you may also do any combination of the above:
      .chattr Fred1 -m+xj-o
   you can also change the flags for Usagi on a specific channel by
   supplying the channel after the attributes:
      .chattr Usagi -m+dk-o #blah
   whether or not you change any flags, it will show you the user's
   attributes afterwards.  if this bot uses the owner flag, only the
   owner may add or remove the 'n' (owner), 'm' (master), 'B' (botnet
   master), and 's' (bot: userfile share) flags.  to get a list of the
   flags possible, do 'help whois'.
