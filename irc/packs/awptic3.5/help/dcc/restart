###  restart
   restarts the Tcl interpreter, wipes all timers and utimers, and
   reloads the config file for the bot, which resets all the 'set'
   variables and reloads any TCL scripts your config loads.  it
   also saves and reloads the user file from disk, just to give
   your disk a little extra wear.
