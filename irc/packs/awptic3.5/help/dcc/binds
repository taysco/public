###  binds [type]
   shows the Tcl bindings in effect, in a list similar to this:
      Command bindings:
        TYPE FLGS COMMAND              BINDING (TCL)
        msg  -    rose                 msg_rose
        msg  -    go                   msg_go
        dcc  m    bind                 cmd_bind
        pub  -    gross                pub_gross
   the fields should be self-explanatory.  if not, go read the
   file 'tcl-commands.doc' for help on the Tcl bind command.  note
   that the builtin commands are now shown.  you may also specify
   a type of binding to show (ie, '.binds msg') if you want to
   narrow the field a bit.
###  binds all
   displays all the Tcl bindings of every type, including the
   bindings for builtin commands such as:
        msg  -    op                   *msg:op
