###  jump [server [port]]
   makes the bot jump to another server.  if you don't specify a
   server, it will jump to the next server in its internal list (see
   'help servers').  if you specify a server, it will jump to that
   server (default port is 6667), and if that server is not in the
   internal list already, it will add it.  jumping servers ALWAYS
   makes the bot lose ops!
