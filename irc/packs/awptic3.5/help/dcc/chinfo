###  chinfo <user> [channel] [info-line]
   sets the information line for a user.  this line is shown via /msg
   commands 'who' and 'whois', and if you have set greet on, it is 
   shown when a user joins the channel.  if the info line begins with a
   '@', then it is "locked", and that user may no longer change it.
   if the channel name is omitted, the default info line is changed.
###  chinfo <user> [channel] none
   erases a user's info line.
