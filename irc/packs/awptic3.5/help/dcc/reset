###  reset [channel]
   clears out the bot's channel information and makes it gather the
   information from the server all over again, as if it had just
   joined that channel.  it's not really useful much, but could be
   if an odd bug causes the channel information to get scrambled.
   unfortunately this command used to get a lot of use.  you can omit
   the channel name to make it reset ALL channels.
