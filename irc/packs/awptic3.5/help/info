/MSG %B INFO [password] [channel] [an info line]
   Whatever you set as your info line will be shown when
   you join the channel, as long as you haven't been there
   in the past three minutes.  It is also shown to people
   when they ask the bot for WHO or WHOIS.  You may set an
   info line specific to a channel like so:
      /MSG %B INFO mypass #channel This is my info.
   Or you may set the default info line (used when there
   is no channel-specific one) like so:
      /MSG %B INFO mypass This is my default info.
/MSG %B INFO [password] [channel] NONE
   This erases your info line.
