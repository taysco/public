###  kickban <nickname> [comment]
   kicks a user off the channel and bans her by a reasonable host-
   mask.  your nickname will be attached to the ban in the bot's
   internal ban list, and the ban will last for whatever is set in
   ban-time -- only on this channel.  use '.+ban' for a more
   permanent ban which will be activated on every channel the bot
   monitors.  if you use a comment, that will also be attached to
   the ban in the ban list, and used as the kick comment.
