###  away [away-message]
   marks you as "away" on the party line.  your away message will
   show up in the '.who' list, and will be displayed to anyone who
   tries to send you a note.  your notes will be stored, and then
   displayed to you as soon as you are no longer away.  saying
   something on the party line will automatically remove your "away"
   status, or you can type '.away' by itself.
