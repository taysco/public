###  status
###  status all
   displays a condensed block of information about how the bot
   is running.  here's an example from Snowbot:
      I am Snowbot, running eggdrop v1.1.1:  400 users (mem: 42k)
      Admin: Robey <robey@wc130.residence.gatech.edu>
      #turtle   :  2 members, enforcing "+tn-mlk"  (greet, bitch)
      #gloom    :  3 members, enforcing "+tn-i"  (greet)
      Server minnie.cc.utexas.edu:6667
      Online for 4 days, 06:18  (background)  CPU 14:18  cache hit 55.3%
      Mode(s): revenge, learn users.

   the first line tells you the bot's name, what version of eggdrop
   it's running, the number of users the bot has records of, and the
   amount of memory being used.

   the second line, if present, is the contents of your 'admin'
   line in the config file.

   next is a line for each of the channels your bot is currently
   monitoring.  for each channel, it lists the number of people on
   the channel ("members"), what channel modes it's trying to enforce,
   and which options are set for that channel.

   if your bot is sharing user files with anyone, and is currently
   either transmitting or receiving the userfile from a bot, it will
   say so here, and tell how many users have been received so far,
   or how many more users need to be transmitted.

   the next few lines show the current server, and if the helpbot is
   in use, its nickname and current server.  to prevent server
   flooding, both the bot and its helpbot use queues to store replies
   to queries from users.  if either queue has a significant amount
   of information in it, this status display will show how full (%%)
   the queue is.

   the next line tells you how long the bot has been online, and
   whether it is operating in the background or foreground.  if it's
   in the foreground, it will tell you whether it's in terminal mode
   or channel display mode.  (terminal mode makes the local console
   simulate a dcc chat connection, and channel display mode displays
   a '.status' and '.channel' output every few seconds.)  it will
   also give you an estimate of the amount of CPU time (minutes and
   seconds) the bot has used so far, and how well the cache is
   working.  (the cache is an attempt to keep the CPU time down, and
   anything over 50% or so is just great.)

   the last line tells any significant modes set with the '.set' 
   command, like revenge, learn users, and userfile sharing modes.

   if you do '.status all' you will see another pageful of info,
   showing every internal setting as specified in the config file.
   it should be self-explanatory to anyone who needs to use it.
