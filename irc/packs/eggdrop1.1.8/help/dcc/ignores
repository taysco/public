###  ignores [wildcard]
   lists the hostmasks that the bot is currently discarding msgs,
   etc from.  the ignores are numbered, so they can be easily
   removed with '-ignore' by number.  a permanent ignore looks
   like this:
      [  1] *!onaji@* (perm)
            Xerxes: spamming me
            Started 18:38
   this kind of ignore can only be stopped by using '-ignore'.
   Xerxes is the one who added it, and his comment is "spamming
   me".  he added it at about 18:38 today.  a temporary ignore
   looks like this:
      [  2] *!*@shellx.best.com (expires at 19:59)
            MyBot: msg/notice flood
            Started 18:59
   that means the ignore was made automatically by the bot at
   18:59, because someone flooded it.  it can be removed with
   '-ignore', or it will expire an hour after it started (this
   is set in 'ignore-time').

   if you use 'ignores <wildcard>' it will list all the ignores
   that match against your wildcard.
