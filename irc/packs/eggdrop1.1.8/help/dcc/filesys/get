###  get <filename(s)> [nickname]
   sends you the file(s) requested, over IRC.  you should get a
   DCC SEND notice on IRC, and have your client accept it.  if
   your nickname on IRC is different than the one you use on the
   bot, you should specify a nickname too.  you can also use that
   to send files to other people.  if a file you want is actually
   on another bot, it may take a little bit longer so be patient.
   if that bot isn't on the botnet right now, it will say the file
   isn't availble.

   there is a limit to the number of transfers you can have going
   simultaneously, so if you go over this limit, the remainder of
   your file requests will be queued.  as the first files finish
   transferring, the queued files will be sent.
