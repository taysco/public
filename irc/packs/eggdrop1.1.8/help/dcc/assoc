###  assoc [<channel #> <name>]
   Creates a name for a channel.  The name will propagate across your
   botnet (if you're hooked into one) and can be used instead of the
   channel # when changing chat channels (see '.chat').  If you omit
   the channel # and name, it will just dump a list of the current
   named channels.

###  assoc [<*channel #> <name>]
   Creates a name for a local channel.  These channels are local to
   the bot itself.
 
###  assoc <[*]channel #>
   Wipes out the name for a channel, if there was one.
