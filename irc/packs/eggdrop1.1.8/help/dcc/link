###  link [some-bot] <new-bot>
   tries to link in a new bot.  if you use the form
      .link newbot
   then your bot must have a record for the new bot (see '.+bot').
   you can either set a password on each end or they will negotiate
   one the first time they link.  if you use the form
      .link somebot newbot
   then the request will be sent to "somebot" for it to link to
   "newbot".
