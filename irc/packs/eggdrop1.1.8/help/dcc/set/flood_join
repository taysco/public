###  set flood-join <#joins>[:<#seconds>]
   specifies the flood threshold for channel joins.  if the
   same host joins the channel more than this many times
   consecutively within 60 seconds, it's considered a flood
   and the host is site-banned.  you can also specify the
   number of seconds to scan by adding that after a colon
   (:).  setting the number of joins to 0 disables join
   flood protection.

   this setting is also used to detect nick floods.
