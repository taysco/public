###  set strict-host <0/1>
   specifies whether the bot should leave leading ~ in users' host-
   names.  if this is on, leading ~ will be left in (the bot will
   differentiate between valid-ident usernames and invalid ones).
   typically this is set off, since most sites are not running the
   ident protocol, and therefore may get ~ put in front of their
   username when their username is valid.
