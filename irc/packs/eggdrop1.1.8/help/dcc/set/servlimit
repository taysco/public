###  set servlimit <#>
   specifies the minimum number of servers the bot should accept.
   if the bot's home channel ever empties out, and the number of
   servers on the irc net becomes less than the 'servlimit', the
   bot will jump to a new server.  this is to prevent it from
   getting stuck on the wrong end of a netsplit.  to disable it,
   just set it to 0.
