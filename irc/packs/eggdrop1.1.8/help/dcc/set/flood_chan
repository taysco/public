###  set flood-chan <#msgs>[:<#seconds>]
   specifies the flood threshold for channel msgs.  if the
   same host sends this many consecutive msgs to the channel
   within 60 seconds, it's considered a flood and the host
   is site-banned.  you can also specify the number of seconds
   to scan by adding that after a colon (:).  setting the
   number of channel msgs to 0 disables channel flood
   protection.
