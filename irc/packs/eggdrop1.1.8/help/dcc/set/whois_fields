###  set whois-fields <field-list>
   tells the bot what "xtra" fields to display in a '.whois' or
   '.match' command.  the "xtra" fields are normally set by
   scripts using 'user-get' or 'user-set' and contain extra info
   about a user.  an example is:
      set whois-fields "url pet"
   which will make '.whois' and '.match' display the values for
   'url' and 'pet' that have been set by scripts.
