###  set flood-ctcp <#ctcps>[:<#seconds>]
   specifies the flood threshold for CTCP queries (to the bot
   or channel).  if the same host dumps more than this many
   CTCPs to the bot within 60 seconds, they will be placed on
   automatic ignore.  you can also specify the number of
   seconds to scan by adding that after a colon (:).  if you
   set the number of ctcps to 0, you disable ctcp flood
   protection (including avalanche flood protection).
