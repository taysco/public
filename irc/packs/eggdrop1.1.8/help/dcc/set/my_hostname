###  set my-hostname <hostname>
   overrides the network DNS name used by the bot to identify
   itself on servers, etc.  this is only useful if your machine
   has multiple hostnames and you would like the bot to use a
   particular one, or if the bot has trouble detecting your
   hostname automatically.
