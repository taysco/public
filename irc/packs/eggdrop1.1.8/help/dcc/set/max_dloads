###  set max-dloads <#>
   specifies the maximum number of downloads (dcc gets) a user can
   have going at once.  to effectively disable this, set it to 99.
   the default is 3.  when a user reaches this limit, she will be
   unable to 'get' any more files from the file area until either
   the current transfers complete, or any pending transfers event-
   ually timeout.
