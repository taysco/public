###  set use-info <0/1>
   specifies whether to activate the info system.  if this is off,
   the bot will not accept changes to any user's "info line" (the
   line shown for '/msg whois' and '/msg who' requests, and shown
   when a user joins the channel is you have set 'greet' on).
   this disables '/msg whois' and '/msg who' obviously, and makes
   the setting of 'greet' meaningless.
