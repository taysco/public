###  channel [channel-name]
   shows you an extensive display of the users on a channel, and
   the current channel attributes.  by default, it shows you the
   channel you are currently viewing on the console, but you can
   specify another channel if you wish.
 
   the first line will look like:
      Channel #hiya, 8 members, 45 users, mode +tn:
   this means that the bot is sitting on channel #hiya, where 8
   other irc'ers are.  there are 45 people that the bot knows by
   hostmask, and the channel mode is +tn.  if the bot isn't on
   the channel it is supposed to be on, it will say "Desiring
   channel #hiya" instead...  next is a list of the users on the
   channel, with each entry looking like this:
       NICKNAME  HANDLE    JOIN   IDLE  USER@HOST
      @kantSF    kantSF    14:53 o  6m  josh@random.edu
   the "@kantSF" means that the user's nickname is kantSF and that
   he is a chanop.  the second "kantSF" is the nickname that the
   bot knows him by.  sometimes this will differ from the nickname
   a person is using.  the time displayed is the time the user
   joined the channel.  the next field is the attributes:
      m - bot master or owner            o - can get ops (+o)
      b - another bot                    d - cannot get ops (+d)
   the last field is the user@host he is using irc from.
