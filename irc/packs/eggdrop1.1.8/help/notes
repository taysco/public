   You must use your password for any NOTES command.
/MSG %B NOTES <password> INDEX
   This lists all the notes stored up for you.
/MSG %B NOTES <password> READ <# or ALL>
   This will display a certain note for you, or, if you used
   'READ ALL', it will show you every note stored for you.
/MSG %B NOTES <password> ERASE <# or ALL>
   This works like READ, except it erases whichever note you
   tell it to (or all of them).
/MSG %B NOTES <password> TO <nickname> <message...>
   This stores a note to someone, as long as I know him or
   her.  They will be informed of a note waiting for them
   the next time they join the channel.
