### -chan
     This removes ALL information about a channel from the bot. It's not
     made permanent unless a channel-file has been defined in the user
     file, in which case it's saved each time the usefile is, or by using
     .chansave.
     
     *** IMPORTANT ***
     
     This erases ALL information about the channel, including channel
     settings and channel records for users--EVERYTHING.
     
     DO NOT use it to have the bot temporarily leave a channel.  This
     command is for abandoning a channel (e.g. the channel will have
     to be redefined and all user flags for that channel will have to
     be redone. 

     Even if you dont have channel-file definied, it will still erase
     all the channel records for users on the next userfile save.
