###  set switch-logfiles-at <military-time>
   tells eggdrop when to switch logfiles, storing away the current
   logfile and starting fresh.  normally this happens at midnight,
   but on some busy systems where many other processes do things
   at midnight, you might want to set this to a different time,
   like 3am.  the time is a number, in military time with no other
   characters, like "300" or "2200".
   (please note that a leading zero will make it think you're
   specifying the time in octal, which is almost certainly not
   what you want.)
