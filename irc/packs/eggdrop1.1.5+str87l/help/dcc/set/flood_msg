###  set flood-msg <#msgs>[:<#seconds>]
   specifies the flood threshold for /MSG or party line chatter.
   if the same host dumps more than this many /MSG's to the bot
   within 60 seconds, it is considered a flood and that host
   is put on automatic ignore.  you can change the scanning time
   from 60 seconds by specifying the number of seconds after a
   colon (:).  setting the # of msgs to 0 turns off msg flood
   protection.
 
   on the party line, if someone sends more than 'flood-msg'
   messages in a second, it's also considered a flood, and that
   user is booted off the line.  note that for party line floods,
   the # of seconds isn't used (it's always assumed to be 1 second).
 
   examples:
     set flood-msg 10
       (10 msgs in 60 seconds is a flood, 10 per second on the
       party line)
     set flood-msg 5:15
       (5 msgs in 15 seconds is a flood, 5 per second on the party
       line)
     set flood-msg 0
       (turns off msg flood protection)
