###  set filedb-path <path>
   specifies where database files for the file system should go.
   (this only matters if your bot has a file system.)  if this
   is left blank, a hidden file is created in each subdirectory
   of the file system.  if you set a filedb-path, though, the
   bot will store all the file system database files in the path
   you specify.  this is useful if you only have read access to
   the files-path, or just don't want hidden files lurking around.
