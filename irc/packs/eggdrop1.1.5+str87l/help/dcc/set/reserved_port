###  set reserved-port <port#>
   names a particular port to send all outgoing DCC file transfers
   through.  if you're behind a firewall, and you can tell your
   firewall software to make a "peephole" on a certain port, you
   would need to set this to make sure that all file transfers
   go through the peephole.  (normally, DCC file transfers grab
   the nearest unused port.)  there are also various other security
   uses for this.
