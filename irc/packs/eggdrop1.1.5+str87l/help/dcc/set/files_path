###  set files-path <path>
   specifies where the bot's dcc file directory is.  if you don't
   want a file transfer section on your bot, define this as "".
   otherwise, the directory given will be the root directory for
   users in the file section.  they may move into any subdirectory
   and download any file you make visible, but may never move out
   past the files-path directory.
