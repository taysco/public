###  set admin <admin-info>
   specifies the admin info for your bot.  it's just human-
   readable text that is displayed every once in a while.  it
   shouldn't be very long (no more than about 60 characters)
   and ought to say who's running the bot, and maybe an email
   address too.  here's an example:
      set admin "Jace the Happy <jason@mtu.edu>"
