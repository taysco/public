###  set temp-path <path>
   specifies a temporary directory where eggdrop can store
   files for a short period of time.  right now this is used
   to hold copies of files while people dcc-transfer them,
   so that changes made to the file in the file transfer area
   won't affect the dcc-get.  under all normal circumstances,
   this ought to be set to "/tmp".
