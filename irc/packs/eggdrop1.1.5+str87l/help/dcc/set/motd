###  set motd <filename>
   specifies the "Message Of The Day" file.  this should be a
   text file.  it will be displayed to users as they enter a
   dcc chat session with the bot (so it shouldn't be TOO long).
   there are a few %-variables you can insert into the motd,
   which will be interpreted by eggdrop:
      %%B   bot's nickname (ie, "%B")
      %%V   current eggdrop version (ie, "%V")
      %%E   long form of %%V (ie, "%E")
      %%C   channels the bot is on (ie, "%C")
      %%A   whatever is set in 'admin' (see 'set admin')
      %%T   the current time (ie, "%T")
      %%N   the current user's nickname (ie, "%N")
      %%%%   a percent sign ("%%")
   you can also encode messages which can only be read by people
   with certain flags:
      %%{+m}Only masters would see this.%%{-}
      %%{+1}Only people with user flag #1 see this.%%{-}
      %%{+b}This is only displayed to users doing a remote '.motd'
      from another bot.%%{-}
      %%{+M}Only channel masters would see this.%%{-}
   Other extended %% commands are:
      %%{cols=N}     start splitting output into N columns
      %%{cols=N/W}   same, but use a screen width of W
      %%{end}        end columnated or restricted (ie %%{+m}) block
