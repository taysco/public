###  set keep-all-logs <0/1>
   specifies whether to keep logs older than 48 hours or not.  if
   this is set off, at midnight, the current logfile will be re-
   named to "(logfile).yesterday" and a new logfile started.  the
   old "(logfile).yesterday" will be erased.  if this is set on,
   at midnight, the current logfile will be renamed to "(logfile).
   (date)" and a new logfile started.  eventually your directory
   will be full of files like "LameBot.log.14Jul94".
