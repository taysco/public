###  whois <nickname>
   will show you the bot information about a user record.  there are
   five headings:
      HANDLE       the handle (nickname) of the user
      PASS         "yes" if she has a password set, "no" if not
      NOTES        number of notes stored waiting for the user
      FLAGS        the list of flags for this user (see below)
      LAST         the time or date that the user was last on the
                      channel
   
   the valid flags under FLAGS are:
      o   global op (bot will op this user on any channel)
      m   master (user is a bot master)
      n   owner (user is the bot owner)
      B   botnet master (user is a botnet master)
      x   xfer (user has file-area access)
      j   janitor (user is a file-area master)
      p   party-line (user has party-line access)
      c   common (user record is a common-access site)  [see 'help common']
      u   unshared (not sent to other share-bots)
      b   bot (user is another bot)
      (plus 10 user-defined flags, 0-9)
   for bots, there are additional flags that can be set:
      s   share (bot is sharing user records)
      h   hub (bot is auto-linked at highest priority)
      a   alternate (bot is auto-linked if no hub bots can be linked)
      l   leaf (bot is not allowed to link in other bots)
      r   reject (bot will not be allowed on the net)
   
   each channel that the user has joined will have a specific record
   for it, with the channel-specific flags and possibly an info
   line.  the channel-specific flags are:
      m   master (user is a master for the channel)
      n   owner (user is an owner for the channel)
      o   op (bot will give this user chanop)
      d   deop (bot will not allow this user to become a chanop)
      f   friend (user is not punished for doing bad things)
      k   kick (user is auto-kicked)
      (plus 10 user-defined flags, 0-9)
   
   hostmasks for the user are displayed on the following lines.
   if the user entry is for a bot, there will be a line below which
   says "ADDRESS:" and gives the bot's telnet address.  some user
   entries may have "EMAIL:" and "INFO:" entries too.
