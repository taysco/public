###  dccstat
   displays a table-format list of all the "dcc" connections the bot
   is handling.  "dcc" means "direct client-to-client communication"
   and eggdrop expands this to cover every open socket.  so any type
   of network connection to the bot is considered a "dcc" connection.
   the headings of the table are:
      SOCK  the socket of this connection (always unique)
      ADDR  the IP-number of the host the connection is to, if
            applicable
      PORT  the port number being used for communication
      NICK  the nickname of the user or bot, if it's a user or bot
      HOST  sometimes, the hostname corresponding to the IP address
      TYPE  the type of dcc connection (see below)

   the types of connection currently possible are as follows (but
   more are being added literally all the time):
      chat  user in dcc-chat command mode
      pass  user entering dcc chat (being asked for her password)
      send  raw data connection: user sending a file
      get   raw data connection: sending a file to a user
      getp  pending get (waiting for the user to acknowledge)
      lstn  telnet listening port (in place of a hostname, it will
              show the proc to call, or mask of acceptable nicks)
      t-in  incoming telnet user (being asked for his nickname)
      file  user in dcc-chat file area
      bot   bot linked in (aka botnet connection)
      bot*  pending bot link (waiting for acknowledgement)
      rela  user in relay connection to another bot
      >rly  bot being relay'd to (one for each "rela")
      conn  pending telnet connection (chat, relay, bot-link, etc)
      new   new user via telnet, entering a handle
      newp  new user via telnet, entering a password
 
   in addition, 'chat' and 'bot' have flags listed for each con-
   nection.  capital letters mean the flag is on, and lowercase
   letters mean the flag is off.  for 'chat', the flags are:
      C     in file area, but allowed to return to party line
      P     party line access only (no +o access)
      T     telnet connection (instead of dcc chat)
      E     echo is on
   for 'bot', the flags are:
      P     ping sent, waiting for reply
      U     user-file sharing is active
      C     this bot initiated the connection
      O     user-file offered, waiting for reply
      S     in the process of sending the user-file
      G     in the process of getting the user-file
      W     warned this bot to stop hubbing
      L     leafed bot (not allowed to hub)
   for 'chat' users, the party-line channel is also listed.
