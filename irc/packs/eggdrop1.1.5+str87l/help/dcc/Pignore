###  +ignore <hostmask> [comment]
   Adds a hostmask to the ignore list, with your nickname and an
   optional comment.  An ignore added manually like this becomes
   "permenent", ie, it will not expire automatically.  To make
   the bot stop ignoring this hostmask, you must eventually use
   a '-ignore' command.  This command can be used to either ignore
   users on irc, or to ignore incoming telnet connections.
