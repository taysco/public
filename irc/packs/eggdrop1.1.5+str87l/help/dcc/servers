###  servers
   lists the servers that the bot has in its server list.  this is
   the list it rotates through when changing servers.  it starts
   with a static list which it loads from its config-file when the
   bot is booted up.  after that, you can add servers with the
   '.jump' command.  the server list will indicate which server the
   bot is currently on.
