###  who [bot]
   lists people on this bot, or bots connected to this bot.  the
   first section is people on your current channel (the party
   line, if you haven't changed channels) who are on the bot.
   a '*' next to the nickname means that user is an owner; '+'
   means they're a master; '@' means they're an op.  the user's
   nickname, hostname, and possibly an idle time and/or away
   message will be displayed:
      *Robey      telnet: nowhere.com

   the next section is bots directly linked to this one:
      -> MagField   (14 Oct 01:16) eggdrop v1.0j
   the arrow indicates who initiated the connection -- the right
   arrow means this bot connected to MagField.  a left arrow
   means they connected to us.  a '+' next to the arrow indicates
   that the bot is sharing userfiles with us.  the connection
   time (14 Oct 01:16) and bot version are also shown.

   the final section is a list of users on this bot who are not
   on your channel.  (this section may be omitted if everyone is
   on the same channel as you.)

   if you specify a bot's name, as in '.who valis', the who request
   will be sent to that bot, as long as that bot is on the botnet.

   masters may also see "(con)" and/or "(talk)" after a user's
   entry -- "(con)" shows that user's console modes (see the
   '.console' help page), and "(talk)" means that user is using
   the enhanced talk ircII script.
  
   in the final section (users that aren't on this channel), masters
   will see the actual channel other users are on.  also, people in
   the file system will be listed (as being in channel "files") -- 
   a '+' next to the nickname here means the user has access to return
   to the party line.
