###  ls [filemask]
   displays the files in the current directory.  subdirectories
   are shown with "<DIR>" next to them, and other files will display
   their size (typically in kilobytes), who uploaded them (and when),
   and how many times each file has been downloaded.  if a descrip-
   tion of the file exists, it is displayed below the filename.  you
   can restrict the file listing by specifying a mask, just like in
   unix.
