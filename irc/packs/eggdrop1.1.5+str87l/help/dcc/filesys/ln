###  ln <bot:filepath> <localfile>
   creates a link to a file on another bot.  the filepath has to
   be complete, like '/gifs/uglyman.gif'.  if the bot is not
   connected to the botnet, nobody will be able to download the
   file until that bot connects again.  the local filename can be
   anything you want.
   example:  ln Snowbot:/gifs/uglyman.gif ugly.gif
