###  chpass <handle> [newpassword]
   changes a user's password on the bot.  if you leave off the new
   password, the user effectively no longer has a password set.  a
   password is needed to get ops, join the party line, and other
   things (but only required if one is set).
 
   NOTE: in previous versions, setting a password to "nopass" would
     clear a user's password -- with encrypted passwords, this no
     longer works!
