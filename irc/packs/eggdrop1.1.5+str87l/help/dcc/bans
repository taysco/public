###  bans [[channel] wildcard]
###  bans all
   shows you a list of the global bans active on the current channel,
   and the list of channel-specific bans, as well as any bans that
   are on the channel but weren't placed by the bot.

   here's a sample entry;
      [ 5] *!*habib@*frys.com (perm)
           paulie: revolving check policy
           Created 15:10
   the number (5) can be used to reference the ban if you wish
   to remove it (see '.-ban').  next is the actual hostmask being
   banned.  the "(perm)" means that the ban is "permanent": that
   is, it doesn't automatically expire.  if there is an elapsed time
   showing instead, the time displayed is how long the ban has been
   active.  those kind of bans expire after one hour.  the second line
   of the ban entry is the comment ("revolving check policy" -- it
   would seem that paulie had to stand in line for a while) and who put
   the ban there (paulie).  the last line shows when the ban was added,
   and possibly the last time the ban was activated on the channel (if
   it's different from the creation time).

   sometimes there will be a "!" or "*" right before the number.  a "!"
   means the ban is in the bot's permban list, but is not currently on
   the channel.  a "*" marks a ban which is NOT in the permban list but
   IS on the channel.

   if you use 'bans' it will show you only the bans which are
   currently in action on the channel.  if you use 'bans all' it
   will show you every ban in memory.  (with 'perm-bans' on, these
   are identical.)

   if you use 'bans <wildcard>' it will list all the bans (active
   or not) that match against your wildcard.  consider it a 'bans
   all' list matched against your wildcard.

   the ban list may change according to which channel you're
   currently viewing in the console.  different bans may be active
   on different channels.  if you specify a channel name, that
   channel will be used instead of your current console channel.
