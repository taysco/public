These are the example scripts that come with eggdrop.  They're meant
to be useful AND to introduce Tcl to those who haven't dealt with it
before.  Even people who program in Tcl may be confused by eggdrop's
implementation at first, because so many commands were added to
interface the bot.

action.fix.tcl
   gets rid of those ugly /me's people do instead of a .me.

alltools.tcl
   toolbox.tcl, toolkit.tcl and a few more tools all in 1 file
   
compat.tcl
   compatability script for really old eggdrop versions

console.tcl
   saves and restores users' console levels

dike.tcl
   detects floodnet attacks and puts offending floodnet members on
   ignore, while sharing the floodnet hostmasks with other bots on
   your botnet (good example of botnet coordination)

getops-1.8.tcl
   a way to get ops from other bots on the botnet (if they're on the
   same channel)

local.tcl
   uses the FILT binding to send text starting with ' to local users
   only (not the rest of the botnet)

ques3.tcl
   makes web pages of who's on each channel, updated periodically
   (requires toolkit.tcl)

samples.tcl
   adds several commands (more good examples)

toolbox.tcl
   cmwagner's collection of handy proc's

toolkit.tcl
   a few useful proc's that may be required by other Tcl scripts

unserv.tcl
   removes a server from the internal server list
 
wire.tcl
   encrypted communications over a botnet
